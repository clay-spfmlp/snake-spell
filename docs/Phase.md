Perfect approach! Let's break this down into manageable phases. Each phase will be a complete, working increment that we can test before moving to the next.
Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Infrastructure
Goal: Get the monorepo structure working with basic client-server connectionDeliverables:
Turborepo + pnpm workspace setup
Basic Vite React client with Tailwind CSS v4
Basic Node.js server with WebSocket connection
Shared types package
Simple "Hello World" client-server communication
Success Criteria:
pnpm dev starts both client and server
Client can connect to server via WebSocket
Hot reload works on both ends
TypeScript compilation works across packages

Phase 2: Single-Player Snake Game
Goal: Classic snake game working in the browserDeliverables:
Canvas-based game rendering
Snake movement with keyboard controls
Food spawning and collision detection
Basic game loop (start, play, game over)
Score tracking
Success Criteria:
Smooth snake movement
Food collection grows the snake
Collision with walls/self ends game
Score displays correctly

Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation
Goal: Multiple snakes in the same arenaDeliverables:
Game room system (join/leave rooms)
Multiple snakes rendering simultaneously
Server-authoritative game state
Basic collision between snakes
Player list display
Success Criteria:
2+ players can join same game room
Each player controls their own snake
All players see the same game state
Snake collisions work correctly

Phase 4: Word Collection Mechanics
Goal: Replace food with letters, add word formationDeliverables:
Letter tiles instead of simple food
Word formation system (collect letters in sequence)
Basic word validation
Score based on word length/complexity
Visual feedback for word building
Success Criteria:
Players collect letters to form words
Valid words give points and growth
Invalid sequences are rejected
Word inventory displays correctly

Phase 5: Advanced Game Features
Goal: Polish and enhance the core gameDeliverables:
Power-ups and special abilities
Game modes (time limits, different objectives)
Better UI/UX (lobby, spectator mode)
Sound effects and animations
Leaderboards
Success Criteria:
Multiple game modes work
Power-ups affect gameplay
Smooth animations and feedback
Complete game experience

Phase 6: Production Polish
Goal: Deploy-ready applicationDeliverables:
Error handling and reconnection
Performance optimizations
Database integration for persistence
Deployment configuration
Documentation
Success Criteria:
Stable with 24 concurrent players
Handles network issues gracefully
Ready for production deployment
Which phase would you like to start with? I recommend Phase 1 to get the foundation solid, but let me know if you want to jump to a different phase or modify any of these goals!Each phase should take a focused development session and give you something tangible to test and play with.
